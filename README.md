# StreamEngine

> **"Long live the free and open internet."**

## Mission
This project was started in the true spirit of the original **Popcorn Time**—to provide an easy-to-use, free streaming source for everyone. The original vision has been hijacked by commercial interests (like Netflix) and fragmented by paid walled gardens. 

**StreamEngine** is a return to form: decentralized, open-source, and free forever.

## Features
*   **Instant Streaming**: No waiting for downloads. Stream torrents directly.
*   **Universal Playback**: Real-time transcoding engine supports MKV, AC3, DTS, and more.
*   **Clean UI**: No ads, no tracking, just content.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Built on Electron and React.
